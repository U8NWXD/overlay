Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
==================================

**Please DO NOT report vulnerabilities in a public GitHub issue or
unencrypted email!**

I ask that you not reveal the vulnerability to anyone until I have fixed
and publicly disclosed it. I am happy to give you credit for reporting
the bug once it is disclosed, but I do not offer bug bounties.

For more detailed information on how you can discover and submit
vulnerabilities, see my vulnerability disclosure policy at
https://u8nwxd.github.io/security/vdp/. This policy also describes
safe-harbor protections for researchers who comply with it.
